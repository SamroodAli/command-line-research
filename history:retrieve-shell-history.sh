# We know every command we enter in an comand shell is often saved in a file.
# The history command lists our previous commands
# history is also a built in command in bash

# list all previous commands
history

# shell saves all executed commands but there is a trick to save a command without
# executing it. Save it as a comment!. Comments in bash start with '#'. Adding a command
# in command shell saves it but isn't executed.
