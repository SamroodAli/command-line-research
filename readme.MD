# Command line research

This is me learning the command line.

## Control key shortcuts

- CTRL + A – takes you to the beginning of the line
- CTRL + E – takes you to the end of the line
- CTRL + K – "yank" everything after the cursor
- CTRL + U – "yank" everything before the cursor
- CTRL + Y - "paste" (paste in quotes because it doesn't actually go into your system clipboard) everything you yanked
- CTRL + L - clear the screen
- CTRL + R – reverse search through history
